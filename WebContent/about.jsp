			<p>
				Most people struggle to fully understand their insurance. Most
				people do not fully understand the payment associated, the
				facilities provided, the time taken and so on. <br> Despite
				numerous websites out there targeting to solve these issues, they
				target only a very small subset of insurances and most often have
				very outdated information. The goal of our application is to help
				the patients find a suitable doctor who would best help with their
				medical needs.
